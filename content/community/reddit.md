Information about the /r/AmongUs subreddit.

## Submission Guidelines

### 1. Relevancy to Among Us

All submissions to [/r/AmongUs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs) must be relevant to AmongUs or directly affect its community. These submissions generally fall into 3 major categories:

- **The Game**: Discussion, News, Guides, Gameplay, Highlights, Feedback

- **Innersloth**: Innersloth Devs and their actions concerning Among Us, AMAs

- **Culture (Fan Content)**: Fanart, Cosplay, Fan Animations, Polls/Surveys, and other user-created content

Submissions of words or real-world objects that bear a resemblance to in-game characters, objects or terminology commonly used in the game are not sufficiently relevant to qualify.

Submissions must be in English or provide an accompanying translation.

Giveaways and AMAs must be [approved by moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FAmongUs&subject=Giveaway%2FAMA+Request).

Polls and surveys must be conducted on reputable survey sites (such as Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, etc). If you have an academic survey that you'd like to post, please [reach out to the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FOverwatch&subject=Academic%20Survey%20Approval) before doing so.

### 2. Title Guidelines

Titles should be not be inaccurate, NSFW, memetic, or contextless. Titles should represent or describe the content of a post, and should have standard spacing and font. Titles that are all CAPS, or do not exceed a minimum length, will automatically be removed.

In the case of gameplay clips, the title MUST provide sufficient context regarding the game. It should be clear what the clip is about before even opening the link. The best way to ensure your post has an appropriate title is by answering both the question of 1) who is in your clip and 2) what is being accomplished (eg. Game clutch with finishing task and chasing Impostor). Any clickbait or attempts at humor without providing context to the play will be removed.

**Spoilers**

Submissions must not have spoilers in their titles. Please use Reddit's [Spoiler tag](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/) if your submission has spoilers in the description, or our own tags if your spoilers are in the comments. This applies to unofficial content leaks.

### 3. Quality Guidelines

Submissions should not revolve around low-value, low-quality, or repetitive content.

Removals are always up to Moderator Discretion. If you disagree with a removal and think that a certain submission should have been allowed, please send us feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FAmongUs&subject=%2Fr%2FAmongUs%20Image%20Macro%20Feedback).

##### Content Threads (Link Posts)

###### Image Posts

**Submissions should not revolve around low-value, low-quality, or repetitive content.**

As a suggestion, we'd prefer posts with direct images to provide context toward said image. Context for an image post can either be included in a discussion post with your explanation in the description, or in a link post with your explanation in a parent comment.

For image posts, low effort screenshots will not be allowed (i.e. purposefully low-quality art). Images will also be subject to our repetitive content guideline seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmongUs/wiki/overused_topic_ban_list).

For fanart, context such as the original creator, creative process or themes prevalent in the work may be useful context to add. When you link to their artist page on DeviantArt, ArtStation, etc. that context is included.

###### Gameplay

Gameplay submissions should primarily contain Among Us gameplay. Highlights should be either *unique, interesting, or skillful*.

Specific examples of Low-Value or Low-Quality content can include, but are not limited to:

* Photos or videos of computer/TV screens. Use recording software or the Print Screen key!

* "The crewmates/impostor left so I won" highlights

* Funny number posts (69, 420, 1337, etc)

* Direct links to Twitch and YouTube channels and streams.

###### Discussion Threads (Self/Text Posts)

Discussion posts must provide room for meaningful discussion. Examples of submissions that do not offer meaningful discussion include, but are not limited to:

* Non-constructive rants and vent threads (including those with excessive poor or vulgar language).

* General complaint threads (matchmaking, toxicity, leavers, etc.)

* Posts with no/minimal text description. These will **automatically** be removed.

* One line joke/pun threads.

###### Reposting and repetitive content

Refrain from posting recently submitted information, questions, or content. As a general rule of thumb, specific information or questions should only be posted with at least a week's separation. Widely known information should be postponed for longer.

Use the Reddit search function before posting your question or content.

### 4. Safe For Work

All content submissions must be **SFW**. NSFW content includes linking to pornography, intense gore, erotic literature, NSFW subreddits, or other sexual content. If you have a question about whether something is NSFW, please **[ask the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FAmongUs&subject=%2Fr%2FAmongUs%20NSFW%20Approval)** before you post. Reddit's NSFW tag should be used for borderline cases, but make sure you ask the moderators first.

###### Borderline Inappropriate Content

Some content might be identified by the community or moderator staff as *borderline inappropriate*. In this case, we will flag a post as **NSFW** as a warning to our users. There is a wide range of fan art and content that envelops the Among Us community, and an equally wide range of cultural acceptance around that content. If we feel a post falls into a potential grey area, we will use this flag as a warning.

## User Guidelines

### 5. Behavior

"Remember the human."

[Wheaton's Law](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law) applies as a general statement.

No personal attacks. Any racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or otherwise hateful speech or material is strictly prohibited. Be civil.

### 6. Terms of Service Violations & Trading

The sharing, buying, selling, trading, or borrowing of accounts, codes, or keys on r/AmongUs, or providing a means to do so is forbidden. 

###### Other Goods & Services

In general, the direct trading of goods or services is forbidden on /r/AmongUs as well. For example, the direct sales of Innersloth merchandise, official or not, is prohibited. Linking to or enabling cheating or hacking is strictly forbidden.

###### Hacking and Cheating

Linking to or enabling cheating, hacking, or any other similar services is strictly forbidden.

### 7. Accusations & Witch Hunts

###### Accusations

* Cheating/Hacking

We do not allow accusations of cheats/hacks. Supplying "evidence" and asking if it is hacking/cheating counts as an accusation, and will be removed.

* Toxicity/Bad Behavior

We donâ€™t allow accusations of bad behavior or toxicity anecdotes on the Among Us subreddit community. If you have been harassed by someone you know, please report them on the platform you use.

###### Witch Hunts

Submissions whose sole purpose is to mock, ridicule, make fun of, or call out an individual or a group of individuals (where the individual's identifying information is visible) will be removed. Please remove all identifying information from your submission before you post. Calls to action will also be removed.

## Site Rules and Guidelines

In addition to all of the rules listed above, we follow and enforce Reddit's [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) including, but not limited to:

#### Vote Manipulation

Do not ask for, hint at or incentivize upvotes. Posts with *"Do Not Upvote"* will **automatically** be removed.

Using alternate accounts to upvote/downvote specific content is against the rules. Suspicious vote activity will result in the admins being notified and a potential ban on suspicious domains, in addition to a subreddit ban on users suspected of participating in manipulation.

#### Posting personal information

Posting somebody's personal information and/or inciting harassment or violence will result in an immediate ban. This includes full names, contact information, and financial information.

#### Promotion

We do not allow promotional posts on our subreddit of any kind.

# Role as Moderator

The role of an r/AmongUs moderator is to provide the best experience to ALL users of r/AmongUs. As such, we reserve the right to:

* Vet posts on a case-by-case basis and determine whether they fall inside of the scope of the subreddit. This includes things like news from other Innersloth games, and divisive topics like politics and world news.

* Create "Announcements", and remove duplicate and repetitive content and topics.

* Remove unapproved automatic posting accounts (bots), or accounts whose sole purpose is to accrue karma.

* Restrict the posting capabilities of accounts that do not maintain a minimum comment karma threshold.

* Temporarily or permanently ban users that do not follow the rules.

*These rights are not intended to allow moderators the ability to do whatever they'd like whenever they feel like. Each submission removal should be accompanied with reasoning for the removal, and a link to our rules, FAQ, and ModMail (so you may reach out to the mod team).*

## Feedback & Help

If you ever feel lost or don't understand any rules or mod decisions, feel free to [contact the moderators via ModMail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmongUs) at any time. While we accept meta posts on r/AmongUs, we encourage users to reach out to the mod team first so we can explain our decisions in a private environment.
