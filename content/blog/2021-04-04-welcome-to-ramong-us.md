Hello everyone! I am happy to introduce everyone to v1 of [ramong.us](https://ramong.us). I conceived this website back in November of 2020 and began building in March of 2021. Since then, it's gone from a pipe dream, to a Vue-based concept, to what you're looking at now.

This is the complementary website to an incredible subreddit that I've been a part of since December 2020, and it's dedicated to being a great resource for learning Among Us and answering any questions anyone might have. Along with being a valuable learning tool, it will also serve as the primary domain for the /r/AmongUs subreddit and its Discord, with information under the "Community" tab about the Discord.

See you in Among Us!
