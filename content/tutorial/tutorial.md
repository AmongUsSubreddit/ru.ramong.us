This tutorial doesn't assume any existing Among Us knowledge.

## Before We Start the Tutorial {#before-we-start-the-tutorial}

We will be playing a mock game of Among Us during this tutorial. **You might be tempted to skip it because you're not interested -- but give it a chance.** The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to winning Among Us.

>Tip

>This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to **learn by doing**. If you prefer learning concepts from the ground up, check out our [step-by-step guide](/docs/hello-world.html). You might find this tutorial and the guide complementary to each other.
