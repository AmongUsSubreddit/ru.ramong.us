## Try Among Us {#try-among-us}

Among Us is free on mobile and can be used with the Android emulator BlueStacks on PC.

## Learn Among Us {#learn-among-us}

People come to Among Us from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.

* If you prefer to **learn by doing**, start with our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html).
* If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step**, start with our [guide to main concepts](/docs/lobbies.html).

Like any unfamiliar things, Among Us does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you *will* get the hang of it.

### Freeplay {#freeplay}

Among Us features a single-player only mode known as Freeplay, which allows you to experiment with any maps with unlimited time and freedom. By selecting the "Freeplay" option in the main menu followed by the map you want to play on, you can experiment with the maps as you'd like. It is recommended to start here when learning Among Us.

When you start the game in Freeplay mode there will be a laptop behind you on a table. Using this laptop you can select which tasks you'd like to do (or mark them as complete), or switch roles by clicking on `Be_Impostor.exe`.

There will also be dummy players spread throughout the map, but they'll be immobile. If you report a dead body or press the emergency button, they will vote at random (which means there's a slight chance of them voting for you, too!). It's possible to win or lose in Freeplay mode, but doing so will simply reset the room.

### Online Play

When you've learned the map you want to play on, you can exit to the main menu of Among Us to join an online match.

>Tip
>
>Avoid being toxic in Among Us. Avoid disconnecting at the start of the game because you're a crewmate or impostor, don't cheat, don't press the emergency button without a reason, and don't insult others when they make mistakes.

### Practical Tutorial {#practical-tutorial}

If you prefer to **learn by doing,** check out our [practical tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html). In this tutorial, we guide you through a mock game of Among Us. You might be tempted to skip it because you're not into mock Among Us -- but give it a chance. The techniques you'll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to Among Us.

### Step-by-Step Guide {#step-by-step-guide}

If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step,** our [guide to main concepts](/docs/lobbies.html) is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won't miss anything as you go along.

### Recommended Videos {#recommended-videos}

Sometimes people find video courses more helpful than our documentation. We maintain [a list of commonly recommended resources](/community/videos.html). All videos are free.

### Advanced Concepts {#advanced-concepts}

Once you're comfortable with the [main concepts](/docs/hello-world.html) and played with Among Us a little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics.

### Glossary {#glossary}

The [glossary](/docs/glossary.html) contains an overview of the most common terms you'll see in Among Us.

## Staying Informed {#staying-informed}

The [Among Us devlog](https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog) is the official source for the updates from the Among Us team. Anything important, including release notes or important notices, will be posted there first.

You can also follow the [@AmongUsGame account](https://twitter.com/amongusgame) on Twitter, but you won't miss anything essential if you only read the blog.

## Something Missing? {#something-missing}
