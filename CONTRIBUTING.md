## Guidelines for Text

**Different sections intentionally have different styles.**

The documentation is divided into sections to cater to different learning styles and use cases. When editing an article, try to match the surrounding text in tone and style. When creating a new article, try to match the tone of the other articles in the same section. Learn about the motivation behind each section below.

**[Introduction](https://ramong.us/docs/getting-started.html)** gives an overview of the docs, and demonstrates two different ways to get started.

**[Tutorial](https://ramong.us/tutorial/tutorial.html)** is relatively informal, and is designed for people who prefer a hands-on approach to learning, and can tolerate skipping theory in favor of practice. Its goal is to give the reader a feel for a typical Among Us match rather than to explain fundamentals in detail. Here we focus on *what* to do and spend less time on *how* or *why* we did it. It is extremely important to do a lot of hand-holding and unambiguously describe every single change. It should be possible for a beginner to mechanically follow every instruction, and be a better player.

**[Main Concepts](https://ramong.us/docs/lobbies.html)** is designed to introduce fundamental concepts in a step-by-step way. Each individual article in Main Concepts builds on the knowledge from the previous ones, so make sure not to add any "cyclical dependencies" between them. It is important that the reader can start with the first article and work their way to the last Main Concepts article without ever having to "look ahead" for a definition. Resist adding too much detail to Main Concepts articles. They intentionally don't cover all corner cases, and focus on establishing firm foundations.

**[Advanced Guides](https://ramong.us/docs/impostor-strategies.html)** are deep dives into topics that aren't essential for a beginner developer but that everyone bumps into sooner or later. They don't have a specific order, and target more experienced developers. If you have a set of guides fitting a particular use case, and those guides aren't opinionated (most Among Us players would agree on them), this is the place to add them.

**[Reference](https://ramong.us/docs/glossary.html)** is organized by terminology rather than concepts. It is intended to be exhaustive.

**[Contributing](https://ramong.us/docs/how-to-contribute.html)** should stay up-to-date and be friendly to relatively experienced developers.

**[FAQ](https://ramong.us/docs/faq-general.html)** has a more conversational tone than the other sections. Here, it's fine to include some content that's not primarily concerned with Among Us, as long as Among Us players are overwhelmingly interested in it. It's also okay to show more than a single way to do something in the FAQ, and briefly discuss the tradeoffs. The FAQ prioritizes unblocking people with a working solution over explaining concepts in detail, and can be more opinionated than the rest of the docs.

**Try to follow your own instructions.**

When writing step-by-step instructions (e.g. how to install something), try to forget everything you know about the topic, and actually follow the instructions you wrote, a single step at time. Often you will discover that there is implicit knowledge that you forgot to mention, or that there are missing or out-of-order steps in the instructions. Bonus points for getting *somebody else* to follow the steps and watching what they struggle with. Often it would be something very simple that you have not anticipated.
